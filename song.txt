i wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

+1+1

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
